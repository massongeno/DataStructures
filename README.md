# DataStructures
All the projects I created for CS 3345 Data Structures &amp; Algorithm Analysis.

Created partially using source code from:

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (Third Edition) by Mark Allen Weiss


Project 1 is a linked list created to simulate memory storage, when you free up an allocated node between two free nodes it will automatically merge all 3 nodes into one.

Project 2 is a binary search tree with the ability to rotate right or left, mirror and compare structures.

Project 3 is a priority queue implementing a binary heap, using a collection of printer requests as an example.
